CHAPTER I
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Friendo. I have just embarked on a small side project to make it super
easy for anyone browsing the GitHub API documentation to quickly find the
Octokit.rb methods that correspond to each API endpoint.

I'm starting this journal as I start the project to document my though proces
and satisfy my own curiosity at the same time. I have used the GitHub API and
have contributed a small bit to Octokit.rb in the past so I am familar with each
fairly well. Once you start using both you get a feel of how the method name
that responds to each api resource. I'm sure there is some unix philosophy in
there about things being what you would expect them or something. I have
terrible selective memory so that may or may not make sense or even exist. Being
the case though sometimes I can't guess the octokit method for api resources and
maybe others have this problem too so here we are.

A quick visit to GitHub and the repo for this project was born the easy way,
even taking the swanky name fuzzy-octo-happiness suggested after several
refreshes. A quick gitub search shows five other projects elected for the same
name. Lettuce see if we can make the name mean something more than just empty
test repos.
