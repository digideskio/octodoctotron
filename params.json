OctoDoctoTron places\r\nall your favorite Octokit.rb methods directly into the absolutely beautiful \r\nofficial GitHub API docs, not only do you see the methods for each API endpoint\r\nbut they link directly to their Octokit.rb docs counterpart for quick reference.\r\n\r\nThis is still an early experiment so try it at your own risk. A sneek peek of it\r\nin action is below as well as how you can install the chrome extension.\r\n\r\n## octodoctotron in action\r\n\r\n![GitHub API docs before](/build/screenshots/api-docs-before.png?raw=true)\r\n![GitHub API docs after](/build/screenshots/api-docs-after.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Easy Mode\r\n\r\n[Install Octodoctotron from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octodoctotron/aaobeelfoiokkmjgiefcfceabhnpimad?hl=en&gl=US)\r\n\r\n### Paranoid mode\r\n\r\nYou can also download the extension file from the [octodoctotron Releases](\r\nhttps://github.com/joeyw/octodoctotron/releases) page.\r\n\r\n### Developer mode\r\n\r\nLastly you can install the extension unpacked by following these steps:\r\n\r\nClone down the repo.\r\n\r\nGo to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).\r\n\r\nEnable developer mode.\r\n\r\nClick load unpacked extension, point to `octodoctotron/build/octodoctotron`.\r\n\r\nVisit [developer.github.com](http://developer.github.com) and enjoy.\r\n\r\n## Hacking on octodoctotron\r\n\r\nTwo parts ruby to one part javascript. The data for octodoctotron is extracted\r\ndirectly from the Octokit.rb source code. Ruby 2.0.0 is being used. The javascript\r\npart is a simple chrome extension that uses the data we extract to inject the\r\nnames of Octokit methods and the links to their docs.\r\n\r\nClone the project then run:\r\n\r\n\tscript/bootstrap\r\n\r\nTests are included for the ruby parts. They test directly against the code of\r\nthe latest Octokit gem. Run them with:\r\n\r\n\tscript/test\r\n\r\nThe build command will extract the doc data from Octokit.rb and compile that\r\ninto the chrome extension. To build simple run:\r\n\r\n\tscript/build\r\n\r\n## How it's made\r\n\r\nI started this project with a [journal](Journal.md) to keep track of my thoughts\r\nand progress. Neat.\r\n","google":"UA-48031305-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
